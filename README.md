ELM327-BUSMASTER
================

Objective
----------------

This project aims to develop a driver for ELM327-compatible devices for using with BUSMASTER software. BUSMASTER is a PC software for monitoring and analyzing communication within data networks in vehicles, such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnected Network (LIN), and FlexRay. The software can be downloaded from the following URL.

Even the BUSMASTER is a commercial grade software which has been released with an open source license by Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions (RBEI) division and maintained by ETAS GmbH, the usage in academic and hobby areas are still limited by the cost of professional hardware. Therefore we would like to overcome such limitation by extending hardware support for ELM327-compatible devices which is the de-facto standard for hobbyists who work with OBD-II interface in their cars. ELM327-compatible interface can be purchased with the price to be less than $100 with various PC interfaces.
